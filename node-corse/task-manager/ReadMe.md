# Task-Manager Readme

- To start, use `npm init -y` to generate the package.json file
- Use `npm i mongodb` to install nodejs packages for mongodb

- After you made the mongodb.js file, run `node mongodb.js`. This will run without stopping. Not sure if this is actually working because some things didn't work. Testing another Tut demonstration.
